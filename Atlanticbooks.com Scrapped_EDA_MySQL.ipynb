    "The box plot provides a clear visual comparison of the price distributions for different book binding types. It highlights that Hardcover books generally have higher prices than Paperback books, while the price distribution for books with missing binding information is more varied. In essence, it suggests that the prices of books where the binding type is unknown show a greater degree of spread or dispersion compared to books with known binding types (Hardcover and Paperback)."
